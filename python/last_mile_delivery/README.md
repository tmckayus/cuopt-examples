# Last-Mile Delivery Optimization

This section demonstrates how to use NVIDIA cuOpt to solve last-mile delivery optimization problems. The notebooks focus on optimizing routes for delivery vehicles and service technicians to various locations.

## Platform Compatibility

If you are running on a platform where cuOpt is not installed, please un-comment the installation cell in the notebook for cuopt.

## Examples

### 1. Delivery Vehicle Routing (CVRP)

The delivery vehicle routing notebook solves a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) where:

- A fleet of delivery vehicles with different capacities must deliver packages from a micro fulfillment center
- Each delivery location has a specific demand that must be fulfilled
- The delivery fleet consists of vehicles with different capacities (trucks and vans)
- The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles while satisfying all delivery demands

#### Key Features

- **Cost Matrix**: Uses a distance-based cost matrix to represent travel costs between locations
- **Demand Modeling**: Incorporates varying demand requirements for different delivery locations
- **Heterogeneous Fleet**: Configures multiple vehicle types with different capacities
- **Constraint Handling**: Demonstrates adding constraints such as minimum vehicle utilization
- **Visualization**: Includes visualization of optimized routes

### 2. Service Team Routing (CVRPTW)

The service team routing notebook (`cvrptw_service_team_routing.ipynb`) solves a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) where:

- Service technicians with different capabilities must visit customer locations to perform services
- Each service location has specific time windows when service must begin
- Service technicians have different skills (represented as capacity to handle different service types)
- Each technician has limited availability (time windows for their work shifts)
- The goal is to minimize the total travel time while ensuring all services are completed within their respective time windows

#### Key Features

- **Time Windows**: Handles both service location time windows and technician availability windows
- **Multi-Dimensional Capacity**: Models technicians with different capabilities for different service types
- **Service Times**: Incorporates time spent at each service location
- **Skill Matching**: Automatically matches technicians to services they're qualified to perform
- **Visualization**: Includes visualization of optimized routes with respect to time constraints

### 3. Benchmark Gehring & Homberger (CVRPTW)

The benchmark notebook (`cvrptw_benchmark_gehring_homberger.ipynb`) demonstrates cuOpt's performance on large-scale academic benchmarks:

- Solves the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) on a dataset of 1000 locations
- Uses the well-known Gehring & Homberger benchmark problems, widely used for comparing VRP algorithms
- Compares cuOpt solutions against best-known solutions from literature
- Demonstrates cuOpt's ability to find high-quality solutions in reasonable time frames
- Tests solution quality with different time limits (1 minute and 2 minutes)

#### Key Features

- **Large-Scale Optimization**: Handles a problem with 1000 locations and 250 vehicles
- **Benchmarking**: Provides comparison metrics against best-known solutions
- **Time Windows**: Incorporates service time windows constraints for all locations
- **Capacity Constraints**: Handles vehicle capacity limitations
- **Performance Focus**: Emphasizes cuOpt's ability to quickly produce high-quality solutions
- **GPU Acceleration**: Demonstrates the benefits of GPU-accelerated optimization for large problem instances

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, for google colab you might need to uncomment and install cuopt wheels based on your cuda version.
2. Run the notebook cells in sequence
3. The notebooks will:
   - Set up the problem data with locations and demands/service requirements
   - Configure the vehicle/technician fleet with appropriate capacities
   - Define the distance/time matrix between locations
   - Solve the optimization problem using the cuOpt Python API
   - Display and visualize the optimized routes for each vehicle/technician

## Expected Output

The notebooks output:
- The total cost (distance/time) of the routing solution
- The number of vehicles/technicians used in the solution
- Detailed routes for each vehicle/technician showing the sequence of locations visited
- Visual representation of the optimized routes

These examples are particularly useful for:
- Retailers and logistics companies looking to optimize their last-mile delivery operations
- Field service organizations scheduling technicians with different skills
- Any business that needs to schedule visits to customer locations while respecting time windows and capacity constraints
- Researchers and practitioners interested in benchmarking routing algorithms against standard problems
