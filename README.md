# cuOpt Examples
NVIDIA cuOpt is a GPU-accelerated combinatorial and linear optimization engine for solving complex route optimization problems such as Vehicle Routing and large Linear Programming problems.
This repository contains a collection of examples demonstrating use of NVIDIA cuOpt via service APIs, SDK and Integration with other OSS optimization solvers.

## Quick Start with Docker

The easiest way to get started with these examples is using cuOpt docker image.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-enterprise/deployment/vmware/latest/docker.html)
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#installing-the-nvidia-container-toolkit)
- NVIDIA GPU with appropriate drivers


## Requirements

For detailed system requirements, please refer to the [NVIDIA cuOpt System Requirements documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuopt/user-guide/latest/system-requirements.html#).

Specific requirements are listed in each workflow's README.md and in the root directory's requirements.txt files.

## Google Colab Enabled

Most of these notebooks are Google Colab enabled. You would need to install cuopt packages before running the notebooks, instructions are provided in the notebooks.
Please refer to the README.md of each notebook for more details whether it is Google Colab enabled or not.

To use these on google colab, you can load notebooks from this [repository directly in google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb). 


### Running the Examples
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuopt-examples.git
cd cuopt-examples
```

2. Pull the cuOpt docker image:
```bash
docker pull nvidia/cuopt:25.05.*
```

3. Run the examples:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --gpus all --network=host -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace nvidia/cuopt:25.05.* /bin/bash
```

4. Install notebook requirements:
```bash
export PATH=/home/cuopt/.local/bin:$PATH
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```
5. Jun jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter-notebook
```
6. Open your browser with the link provided in the terminal, and you can see the notebooks.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by use cases, with each directory containing examples and implementations specific to that use case. Each use case directory includes:
- Example notebooks
- Implementation files
- README.md with specific instructions
- requirements.txt for any additional dependencies that this notebook may require

## Featured Examples

### Intra-Factory Transport Optimization
The `intra-factory_transport` directory contains an example of using the cuOpt SDK API to solve a Capacitated Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (CPDPTW) for optimizing routes of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) within a factory environment.
