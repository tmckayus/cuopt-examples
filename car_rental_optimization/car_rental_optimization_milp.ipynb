    "# Car Rental Optimization with cuOpt Python API\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to solve a car rental optimization problem using the cuOpt Python API. The problem involves determining the optimal fleet size and distribution of vehicles to maximize weekly profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A car rental company operates in multiple locations. They need to determine:\n",
    "- How many cars to have in their fleet\n",
    "- Where to position cars each day\n",
    "- How many cars to transfer between locations\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to maximize weekly profit while:\n",
    "- Meeting rental demand at each location\n",
    "- Considering transfer costs between locations\n",
    "- Respecting operational constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: This model makes the following simplifying assumptions:\n",
    "1. **Same-day rentals**: All cars rented on a given day are returned to the same location by end of day\n",
    "2. **Daily optimization horizon**: Decisions are made on a daily basis over a one-week period\n",
    "3. **Known demand**: Rental demand at each location is known in advance\n",
    "4. **Homogeneous fleet**: All cars are identical (no vehicle classes)\n",
    "5. **Overnight transfers**: Car transfers between locations happen overnight and are available the next day\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation is well-suited for:\n",
    "- Airport shuttle services\n",
    "- City car-sharing programs\n",
    "- Daily rental operations\n",
    "- Short-term rental businesses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For multi-day rentals where cars don't return the same day, the model would need additional variables to track rental duration and expected return dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is inspired by the classic car rental optimization example and is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference**: Adapted from [Gurobi's Vehicle Rental Optimization Model](https://www.gurobi.com/jupyter_models/vehicle-rental-optimization/)\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how to use cuOpt linear programming API to solve a car rental optimization problem inspired by the Gurobi modeling example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Achieved:\n",
    "1. **Optimal fleet size** to maximize profit while meeting demand\n",
    "2. **Daily allocation** of vehicles across locations\n",
    "3. **Transfer recommendations** to rebalance inventory efficiently\n",
    "4. **Performance metrics** for business decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Advantages of cuOpt:\n",
    "- **GPU Acceleration**: Significantly faster than CPU-based solvers\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Handles problems with thousands of variables and constraints\n",
    "- **Integration**: Easy to integrate into existing Python workflows\n",
    "- **Real-time**: Fast enough for operational decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Model Assumptions:\n",
    "This model assumes **same-day rentals** where all cars return to their origin location by end of day. This simplification works well for:\n",
    "- Car-sharing services (Zipcar, Car2Go)\n",
    "- Airport rental shuttles\n",
    "- Daily urban rentals\n",
    "\n",
    "However, traditional car rentals often involve **multi-day bookings** and **one-way rentals** (rent at airport, return downtown).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Extensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Priority - Multi-day Rentals:**\n",
    "- Track rental duration with variables `rent_start[d][l]` and `rent_duration[d][l]`\n",
    "- Add constraints for car availability during rental period\n",
    "- Model one-way rentals allowing cars rented at location i to be returned at location j\n",
    "- Include reservation system with time windows for pre-booked rentals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Enhancements:**\n",
    "- Add seasonal demand variations and holiday effects\n",
    "- Include different vehicle types and classes (economy, SUV, luxury)\n",
    "- Model maintenance schedules and vehicle downtime\n",
    "- Add stochastic elements for uncertain demand\n",
    "- Optimize over longer time horizons (monthly, quarterly)\n",
    "- Include customer service levels and overbooking strategies\n"
